"This file contains the fraction of flux transmitted by an advanced attenuator system including a stack of 8 silicon attenuators, each with a thickness of 60um and a hole diameter of 6um. These properties were optimized to give approx 2000 cts/s across the entire detector from an M3.5 flare coronal source as observed by a FOXSI-3 10-shell optic including blankets at 1AU."
